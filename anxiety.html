<p>You do not need to continue this struggle alone.  We are here to help you get unstuck from anxiety patterns and live the life that is important to you.  Anxiety does not have to control you, and we can show you how to break free from harmful patterns in your life.</p><hr/>

<p>Anxiety can often interfere with our relationships with others and ourselves.  It can commonly interfere with our ability to perform to our optimal level of functioning.  Our goal is to help children and adults relate to anxiety in a healthy way.  Anxiety can be helpful to inform our decisions.  It becomes a struggle when we misinterpret cues and information our body is giving us.<br><br>Anxiety can interfere with parenting abilities, work, school, or sport performance.  Symptoms include dizziness, feelings of panic, chest pain, and disrupted sleep patterns.  Learning strategies can help you excel in your life.  We have also worked with many people who have anxiety in their intimate relationships that contributes to distance rather than fostering closeness.  In any form that anxiety reveals itself, whether physically or mentally, there are many strategies to help you.<br><br>One strategy is through the use of biofeedback.  Biofeedback continues to emerge as a scientifically based treatment for many conditions.  Biofeedback is a therapeutic tool which provides physiological information in order to help individuals improve self-regulation.  We can measure heart rhythm patterns in real time to inform ways to decrease stress in your life.<br><br>Another form of treatment is EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).  EMDR treatment encourages healing of traumatic memories that have not been processed properly.  Healing can be achieved from a history of abuse, domestic violence, or negative memories.  EMDR is a structured way to offer relief, to process memories fully, and develop adaptive changes in your life.</p>
