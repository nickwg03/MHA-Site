<p>We will work to progress your professional development in order to accomplish your goals.  We offer cutting edge strategies to provide effective, reflective supervision.  Reflective supervision offers a space for you to process your experience so you can use your experience in effective ways and not allow your challenges to interfere with clients' progress.  We all have limitations, but when we are aware of these then we can be free from being controlled by them.  Our goal is to provide a new experience for professionals in order to enhance their own development, whether it is through supervision on a case by case basis or supervision to complete licensure requirements.  Techniques and strategies will be learned and trainees will begin to feel more comfortable with the flow of change for the client in the therapeutic relationship.</p><p>If you or your agency would like to pursue the possibility of collaborating with us, then we can meet to assess needs and develop a plan for all involved.  We will work to provide an experience that offers substantial identifiable benefits.  Give us a call to see how we can be of help.</p>
<p>We are aware of the limited amount of postdoctoral training programs available, and we would like to help a postdoctoral candidate complete their supervision hours.  We know there are good professionals, many who have had great training experiences, that are not able to find a training program, and we are hoping to fill this gap until APA makes some needed changes.  We will work with you to determine what your needs are for licensure and to help you fulfill your passion for helping others.  We are looking for candidates with a similar philosophy in helping the community that matches well with our center.</p>
<p>Dr. Roberts has developed a treatment manual for a multi-family group called Growing Together.  The group was originally developed to support Adolescent Moms and Babies.  If you are interested in implementing this program in your area then please contact her.  We can work together to help these families receive the care and support they need.</p>
