<p>Mindful Health Advantage was co-founded by psychologists Dr. Shawna Roberts and Dr. TJ Price, after frustrations with large systems that treat clients as a number rather than with quality care.  We combined knowledge and resources to be more beneficial to the community.  We work to guide people to experience the power of positive change.  We have had the opportunity to have wonderful associates that work with Mindful Health Advantage.<hr/>

<p>I am committed to helping individuals heal the past, empower the present, and achieve a future that is meaningful and valued.  I understand the importance of building relationships with my clients based upon trust and respect. Many clients have described me as compassionate, accepting, and helpful in guiding people to have the life they have longed for.  My hope would be to offer you a rewarding experience.<br><br>I earned my Doctorate of Psychology from the University of Denver after completing my masters degree.  I have a variety of training and experiences in working with adults and children, often considered an anxiety expert when I am able to help people calm down and enjoy life.  I specialize in anxiety disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), panic attacks, and phobias.  I am an Adjunct Professor at the University of Denver, and I also teach child development and assessment at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.  I am EMDR certified and am able to use this method with clients who need their past to stop interfering with their present, a wonderful way to allow yourself to let go of old hurts and heal. I have also enjoyed helping athletes through sports psychology.  I understand the need and desire for optimal performance having been a college-athlete.<br><br>When I am not working, I enjoy hiking, playing volleyball and softball, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>

<p>I earned a Doctor of Clinical Psychology Degree in 1993 from the University of Denver , have been a Licensed Psychologist since 1995, and have been trained in EMDR.  I have a wide variety of training and life experiences, and am dedicated to help people take steps to build lives they can, and will, value.<br><br>I often assist professionals, and people who have had negative experiences in therapy, to see what more is possible.  I live/work from a belief that there is always a better way to do things - and that life is not about finding ourselves, it is more about creating or co-creating ourselves.<br><br>I have over a decade of training and experience assisting people who come from domestic violence homes, and I am the lead author in a treatment manual for Moms and Kids from Domestic Violence (research has shown that mothers are more often the victims of domestic violence than fathers).  It is a fairly unique program in that a parent and their children meet at the same time in separate, developmentally appropriate, groups to help them find their voices, deal with what is important to them, and heal.  If you are interested in this program or manual, please feel free to inquire.</p>

I specialize in working with adult clients (individual and couples) who are dealing with a variety of issues, including anxiety, depression, adjustment difficulties, and relationship problems.<br><br>I like to work collaboratively with my clients to develop treatment goals and then customize my approach to meet their individual goals and needs.</p>
