<p>Check out our <a href="files/DDRC_workshop.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Empowerment Workshop!</a> Join other parents who may be feeling challenged with life stress or children's misbehavior, we have the support for you.
You will leave this workshop feeling recharged and ready to take on the most difficult job, being a parent!</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide comprehensive mental health care for children including <em>family therapy</em>, <em>individual therapy</em>, and <em>play therapy</em>.  Children use behaviors as their language to express concerns.  Many of these behaviors can be disturbing to parents.  Most children receive therapy to build <em>better relationships</em>, <em>treat developmental delays</em>, <em>focus attention</em>, <em>resolve sleep and eating difficulties</em>, <em>decrease anxiety</em>, or improve the ability and motivation to <em>follow directions</em>.  Disorders commonly treated include ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, adjustment difficulties, and depression.  Social and emotional development gains can guide children to have wonderful, successful adult lives.</p><p>Dr. Roberts teaches <em>early childhood development</em> at the University of Denver, and she teaches <em>child assessment</em> as part of the <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/psychiatry/PsychEducation/Psychology/PsychologyFellow/Harris/Pages/Roberts,%20Shawna.aspx">Faculty</a> of University of Colorado Health Sciences Center as a <em>child psychologist</em>.  With her specialty in child development, her hope is to provide treatment that can be effective for your children and family.  She has expertise in treating <em>postpartum depression</em> and challenges that come with being a new parent.  She works to <em>improve infant development</em> and <em>toddler mental health</em> for children who may be difficult to soothe. She is passionate in her work with children of all ages who are expressing their need for treatment through behavioral or mood difficulties.  She also enjoys being a member of the <a href="http://www.coaimh.org/" target="_blank">Association for Infant Mental Health.</a></p>
<p>Dr. Price has years of experience working with children and families.  He has found many successes and is often described as innovative to find ways that work for families to change.</p>
